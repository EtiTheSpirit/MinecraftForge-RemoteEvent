# MinecraftForge-RemoteEvent
Implements something similar to Roblox's RemoteEvent class. http://wiki-origin.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/RemoteEvent

This isn't 100% necessary but I thought I'd do it for giggles.

# Usage
Just drag 'n' drop the source code into your mod.

# Make sure to select the proper branch for your version
